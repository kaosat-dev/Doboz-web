Experimental remote monitoring and control system for Repraps/Repstraps/3d scanners. 
It includes a Web client (using Javascript + Jquery + WebGl) and server (pure Python ):

//////////////////////////////

Depencies:
* For now only tested with python 2.6
* You will need to have pySerial installed
* By default , the web server is now set to use wsgiref (no external dependency required) : to change that , just change the ServerType in the config.cfg file in the "WebServer" section
to any other web server supported by Bottle (preferably Tornado for now)
