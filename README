UPDATE: 04/17/2011
-The project now comes with buidout scripts for easier deployment : no need to have the dependencies installed: here is how you can setup and run 
Doboz-Web using buildout:
-check out the code from github
in command line :
- navigate to the directory you just checked out the code into 
- type python bootstrap.py (Optionally you can do pythonVERSIONNUM bootstrap.py : ie i use python2.6 bootstrap.py)
- type bin/buildout : here you will see buildout getting all the project dependencies and setting up an isolated python environment
DONE!
To run the project , just type , at the same place: bin/dobozweb


Depencies:
* For now only tested with python 2.6
* You will need to have pySerial installed
* You will also need pyParsing
* for webcam support , pygst is required too
* to generate docs, sphinx and all its dependencies are required
* By default , the web server is now set to use wsgiref (no external dependency required) : to change that , just change the ServerType in the config.cfg file in the "WebServer" section
to any other web server supported by Bottle (preferably Tornado for now)
