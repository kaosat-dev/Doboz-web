# Creates a C code lookup table for doing ADC to temperature conversion
# on a microcontroller
# based on: http://hydraraptor.blogspot.com/2007/10/measuring-temperature-easy-way.html
# Modified Thu 10 Feb 2011 02:02:28 PM MST jgilmore for 5D_on_arduino firmware
#	temps are now in 14.2 fixed point notation (i.e. measured in quarter-degrees)
#	temps are not permitted to be negative (BUG:may result in numtemps fewer than requested)
#	bugfix: --num-temps command line option works.

"""Thermistor Value Lookup Table Generator

Generates lookup to temperature values for use in a microcontroller in C format based on: 
http://hydraraptor.blogspot.com/2007/10/measuring-temperature-easy-way.html

The main use is for Arduino programs that read data from the circuit board described here:
http://make.rrrf.org/ts-1.0

Usage: python createTemperatureLookup.py [options]

Options:
  -h, --help			show this help
  --r0=... 			thermistor rating where # is the ohm rating of the thermistor at t0 (eg: 10K = 10000)
  --t0=... 			thermistor temp rating where # is the temperature in Celsuis to get r0 (from your datasheet)
  --beta=...			thermistor beta rating. see http://reprap.org/bin/view/Main/MeasuringThermistorBeta
  --r1=...			R1 rating where # is the ohm rating of R1 (eg: 10K = 10000)
  --r2=... 			R2 rating where # is the ohm rating of R2 (eg: 10K = 10000)
  --num-temps=... 	the number of temperature points to calculate (default: 20)
  --max-adc=... 	the max ADC reading to use.  if you use R1, it limits the top value for the thermistor circuit, and thus the possible range of ADC values

It is suggested to generate more values than you need, and delete some of the ones in the ranges
that aren't interesting. This will improve accuracy in the temperature ranges that are important to you.
